# Ng4Leaflet

For available tiles see:
[https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/)

For leaflet to work:
```bash
npm install leaflet --save
```

add leaflet.js and leaflet.css to ```.angular-cli.json``` just like in this project. Then just import leaflet like
```typescript
import leaflet from 'leaflet'
```

see: ```bash app.component.ts```
